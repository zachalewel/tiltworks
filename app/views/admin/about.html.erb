        We went full-on MacGyver and hatched a new approach to
        developing apparel graphics. T-hive is a re-think of everything involved
        in all aspects of creative development process, enabling much greater levels
        of collaboration and even changing the very nature of how art is created.
        <br>
        <br>
        It gives us the ability to reach out to a creative
        community en masses through open call projects; or
        in a more selective fashion, pulling together the artistic equivalent
        of a Special Ops team for a specific assignment.

        T-hive also serves as the communication center for all projects, providing the entire team with real time
        updates on art development and scheduling. A project can be monitored throughout its entire history, from the
        initial call for ideas
        right up through its preparation for production.
        <br>
        <br>
        Freelance contributors get on the T-hive train as well with access to a ﾠlibrary of relevant project
        materials and information as well ﾠwebinars and tutorial videos. All file transfers, including in-progress
        imagery and master files, are handled through the secured T-hive interface and freelancers can even keep tabs on
        their project histories, open call submissions or invoices.
